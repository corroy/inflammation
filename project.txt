Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after surgery 

Jane is a Dat Scientist and Samit is a statistician. We will need to determine who is responsible for what in this project. 

We may need to bring in a thrid persion with Python programming skills into this project.

A highly skilled person
